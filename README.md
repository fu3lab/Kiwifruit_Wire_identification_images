# Original dataset
A total of 142 images constituted the original dataset, which was randomly partitioned into training set (99) and testing set (43) with a ratio of 7 : 3. After adopting thirteen dataset augmentation methods augmentation, the original training set was expanded from 99 images to 1287 images.

# Overlap-partitioned dataset
To further enhance the proportion of grid wire pixels in an image, the original image in this study was overlap-partitioned into the overlap-partitioned dataset.
After overlap-partitioning, each original image with 2560 × 1440 pixels was overlap-partitioned into 6 sub-images with a resolution of 1024 × 800 pixels, sequentially from top-left to bottom-right. The overlapping rate between adjacent sub-images was set at 20%. Finally, the number of images in the dataset was 852, and 594 images in the training set.
